# SymaX5SW Rx and Tx

Research carried out on a SYMA X5SW Drone with three defined objectives.

1. Intercept the telemetry of the Drone and display it in a graphical interface in real-time.

2. Create a transmitter (command control), using RF, Arduino modules and C code.

3. Intercept the video stream of the camera and look for vulnerabilities in it.

First, we will talk about some basics of radiofrequency, tips to start a project of this type and the problems that occurred throughout.
